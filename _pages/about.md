I am an Assistant Professor in the Institute of parallel and distributed systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
My research interests include <b>operating systems, architecture, system security (TEE), serverless computing and HW/SW co-design</b>.
I have built several systems including Penglai TEE (state-of-the-art RISC-V TEE), serverless systems (Catalyzer, ServerlessBench, and Molecule), and RISC-V IPC extension (XPC).
I am also working on open-sourced communities, including RISC-V (SPMP TG chair), openEuler (RISC-V SIG maintainer) and OpenHarmony (RISC-V and TEE SIG maintainer).
